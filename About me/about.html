        I used to do regular ICT classes when I came to know about coding in Inter 2nd year. I still didn't know about coding well. Then I gave HSC and then got admission in new honors, in the meantime I used to look for coding online on various platforms, then I used to watch the video from there and practice it myself.

        What is the use of watching videos and nodes if you can't write coding practically in a coding software, if you can't know which tag is actually used for? You have to practice coding every day and learn how to use new tags.

        You may know that when someone is coding in front of you or in a video, the most difficult thing in the world seems to be that I am being asked to write or watch or learn. But if it is a habit to learn regularly then I believe it is very easy.

        The first time I saw my coding was all over my head. But I like to see that I can make something myself, I will have my own website like others, I will have my own platform, I will manage everything myself. I worry every day if coddong others can Why can't I? I am also human, so I can also believe in myself. In fact, the belief thing is very good that you will feel good about everything you have with that thing.

        I watched a lot of videos to learn coding I spent a lot of time working hard then came this far. Nothing is easy to find, you have to work hard. So I would say build confidence in yourself.

        Many people ask me what to do to learn coding? I would say there are many videos about these online, just go and search and learn selectively. Anyone can learn a coding language as they like. So if you want to learn, you will find many videos on YouTube.
